# Debugging

## `console.log()`



## `typeof`



## Single and double quotes

JavaScript allows the use of both single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes to declare a string. There is no manual which one to use.

You can use both or use only one with backslash (`\`).

```js
const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
```
