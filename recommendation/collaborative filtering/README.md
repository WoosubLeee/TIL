# Collaborative filtering

One important thing to keep in mind is that in an approach based purely on collaborative filtering, the similarity is not calculated using factors like the age of users, genre of the movie, or any other data about users or items. It is calculated only on the basis of the rating (explicit or implicit) a user gives to an item.
